//! This crate defines interfaces that enable the extension of the Starcoin VM with native functions.
//!
//! Native functions provide the ability to incorporate semantics that cannot be expressed in
//! normal Move programs.
//!
//! They are also commonly used to accelerate certain operations, such as cryptographic hashes,
//! by executing them in native code.
