# Security Policy

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Starcoin project.

> Note: As Starcoin is currently in the prototype stage and does not power a blockchain with a cryptocurrency that has real-world value, our security procedures are not fully in place. We will release a more complete disclosure policy prior to the launch of the mainnet.


## Reporting a vulnerability bug

Just submit an issue on github [Submit a security bug](https://github.com/starcoinorg/starcoin/issues/new).
