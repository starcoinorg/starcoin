# The Move Prover

The Move Prover supports formal specification and verification of Move programs. It can automatically prove
logical properties of Move smart contracts, while providing a user experience similar to a type checker or linter.
It's purpose is to make contracts more *trustworthy*, specifically:

- Protect massive assets managed by the Starcoin blockchain from smart contract bugs
- Anticipate justified regulator scrutiny and compliance requirements
- Allow domain experts with mathematical background, but not necessarily software engineering background, to
  understand what smart contracts do
