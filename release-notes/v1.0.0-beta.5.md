Network protocol upgrade, optimize transaction broadcast protocol; Support stratum mining pool protocol; Move contract upgrade method optimization: support incompatible upgrade through governance, and implement hard fork through on-chain governance (sip-4).

> Note: starcoin nodes should upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible, a hard fork test will be conducted soon, which will cause nodes with older versions to be unable to execute the latest blocks.
