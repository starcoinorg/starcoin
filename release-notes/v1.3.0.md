Move version upgrade, command line development tool improvement, miner client support stratum mining pool protocol, stdlib v5 follow-up update

Compatibility notes:

1. cleaned up and refactored some cli commands, some commands are not compatible
2. The account address literals in the new Move source code need to be prefixed with `@` symbols, for example, `0xA550C18` needs to be changed to `@0xA550C18`.

Upgrade recommendation:

Please upgrade to the new version to be ready for open third-party Move contract deployment
